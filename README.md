osinfo
====================

osinfo

This tool will acquire important hardware and operating system details of an instance of Operating System, Virtual Machine, Appliance, Container or any other popular system that allows operation of programs.

Details could include hardware or virtual hardware attributes, as well as operating system or firmware attributes.

For now this tool will focus on Unix and Linux variants Operating Systems only.

Supported Platforms:

1. Solaris 8,9,10,11, including LDOMs and all kinds of Zones on all hardware types
2. Redhat Linux on all Hardware types

How to use osinfo.sh:

Login to the system as root
mount OSINFO tool directory via NFS
cd to the osinfo directory
./osinfo.sh

This tool will NOT show virtual network cards â€“ it is aimed to point to physical devices only.
On Solaris zones it will not allow operation since it takes all its resources from the host machine.
